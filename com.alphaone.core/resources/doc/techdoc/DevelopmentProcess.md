# Development process

Excepts for the first few cycles for general planning and architectural planning, all development cycles should follow the development process described this section.

## Phases overview

in general, each development cycle contains following phases:

* Conceptual design & Integration test
* Planning
* Implementation design
* Functional implementation & Integration test implementation
* Integration test
* General Acceptance

Github issues system will be used to create tasks, assign tasks to people in group and to manage tasks progress.

## Conceptual design and integration test

This phase includes following tasks: 

* Conceptual design for functions to be implemented in this cycle
* Functional/integration test specification for those functions

There must be also design documentation & test specification created and specified in the corresponding issue.

## Planning

This phase includes:

* Creation of a function task & a test task for each function identify in the conceptual design phase
* Properly assignment of task to person

There is currently no deadline in this project. Tasks should be finished when it is .. finished.

## Implementation design

This phase is for detailed design on implementation level for each function. There should be also technical documentation created
and specified in the corresponding issue.

## Functional implementation and integration test

This phase includes following tasks:

* Implementation of each function, including JUnit tests when necessary to test complex method at JUnit level
* Implementation of functional integration test

## Integration test

This phase is for executing integration tests & bug fixes.

## General acceptance

This is actually a milestone to assess the quality of development in the whole cycle.
